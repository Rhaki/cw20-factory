# CW20 FACTORY

The `cw20-factory` derived from the standard `CW20` implementation, designed to streamline the management of tokens both in the `CW20` and native formats through the use of a `Token Factory`. During the initial phase of contract initialization, the `native` version of the `token` is also produced via the `Token Factory`. This implementation retains the original` entry point`s of the `cw20-base`, yet it is enhanced with the `ExecuteMsg::TransmuteInto` functionality. This feature allows users to convert `native` tokens into `CW20` formats and vice versa.

In parallel, an auxiliary contract named `Indexer` is introduced, tasked with mapping between the `denom` associated with the `Token Factory` and the `CW20` address. This association process occurs automatically during the `cw20-factory` initialization.

To ensure proper management of the various types of `Token Factories` across different blockchains, the contract requires, at the compilation level, the use of a structure that implements the `TokenFactoryInterface` trait. This trait serves as a communicative bridge with the specific `TokenFactory` module of each blockchain, maintaining the base code's independence from interchain variations.
